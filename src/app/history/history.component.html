        <p>J/Vembadi Girls’ High School summons a long chronicle with perceptible accomplishment among the schools in the Northern Province. It boasts of a long history with rich grandeur. Methodist Missionaries, who arrived from England, decided to start a school for girls. When we looking back at the precedent history, there were several past principals who rendered their dedicated service to the school intensely. The first principal was Mrs. Peter Percival who assumed duties in the year 1837. The first National Principal was Ms.Mabel Thambiah. J/Vembadi Girls’ High School was taken over by the government in 1960. In 1984 this school became a National School. The school underwent much difficulty during the years 1984-1996 due to the civil war It has lost its majestic buildings which stood as monuments of the rich heritage.</p>
        <p>We can’t forget the period of Mrs.K.Ponnampalam (1996 –2011). She courageously rebuilt the school with the help of the Ministry of Education, parents, well-wishers and old girls. She labored hard to restore the school’s pristine glory. However, the hostel facility for the students is not available after the civil war and students from faraway places face difficulties due to this short coming. The fame has grown higher and higher in recent period under the stewardship of the present principal Mrs.V.Shanmukaratnam who took over her duty on 2.7.2012 in this institution. Two new buildings were constructed during the period 2013-2016 for the Technological Laboratory and Technological Faculty and handed over to the students’ activities in 2015 and 2016 respectively. At the same time we have lost the space for the playground as we took a part of the playground for the above construction works.</p>
