It boasts a long history with rich grandeur. Methodist Missionaries, who arrived from England, initiated their service here to broaden the education by establishing an English School. This English School, called as The Weslyan Central School, was situated at the present Vembadi Premises. Later they felt the need to educate the girls in the Jaffna society. So they decided to start a school for girls. So The Boys English School (Present Central College) was shifted to the adjoining premises. When we look back at the precedent history, there were several past principals who rendered their service to the school intensely.</p><br>
